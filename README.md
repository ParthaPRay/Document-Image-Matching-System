## Key Features
1. **AI-Powered Image Analysis**
   - Utilizes an OpenAI vision model to generate textual descriptions from images.
   - Summarizes descriptions into concise keywords.

2. **Open Library Integration**
   - Searches the Open Library database using extracted keywords.
   - Retrieves book details, including titles, authors, and publication years.

3. **Async Processing Pipeline**
   - Efficiently handles asynchronous operations for image analysis and book search.
   - Converts images to base64 for seamless API interaction.

4. **User-Friendly Interface**
   - Developed with Gradio for an interactive, easy-to-use platform.
   - Allows users to upload images and view results directly in the application.

## System Workflow
1. **Image Upload**:
   - Users upload an image through the interface.

2. **Image Processing**:
   - The system converts the image to base64 format.
   - The encoded image is analyzed by OpenAI's vision API for descriptive text.

3. **Keyword Extraction**:
   - The descriptive text is summarized into concise keywords.

4. **Book Retrieval**:
   - Extracted keywords are used to query the Open Library API.
   - Relevant book details are fetched and displayed in a tabular format.

5. **Result Presentation**:
   - Keywords and corresponding books are shown in the application for user review.

## Requirements
### Environment Setup
- Python 3.8+
- Required libraries:
  - `os`
  - `base64`
  - `requests`
  - `pandas`
  - `gradio`
  - `asyncio`
  - `dotenv`
  - `openai`

### Configuration
